My goal was to teach a neural network to play Tic Tac Toe starting from only knowing rules.

At first I Implement Tic Tac Toe logics by C++ Object Oriented. (Desc)

Let's describe my network.
A Neural Network consists of serval layers: an input layer, some hidden layers and an output layer. Every layer can be represented as a vector and consists of a specified number of units.
In my project we have 4 layers: an input layer that has 9 units (10 units with bias term), a couple of hidden layers both of which have 36 units and an output layer that has one unit.
